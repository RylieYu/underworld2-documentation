### Moresi and Solomatov 1995

Stagnant lid convection model that demonstrates how to produce non-dimensional models with
a temperature dependent (Frank-Kamenetskii) viscosity and how to record Nusselt number and Vrms for a simulation in a way that transfers correctly to a parallel environment. Also demonstrates saving and restarting for long run-times.

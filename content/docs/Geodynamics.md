### Equations

The dimensionless (indicated by primes) Navier-Stokes equation can be written

$$
	\frac{1}{\textrm{Pr}} \frac{D \mathbf{v}'  }{Dt' }  =
	\acute{\nabla}^2  \mathbf{v}'  -  \acute{\nabla} p' + \textrm{ Ra} T' \hat{\mathbf{z}}
$$

We will work in the infinite Prandtl number limit in which intertial terms vanish, and we will also assume incompressibility

$$
\nabla^2  \mathbf{v}  -  {\nabla} p = -\textrm{ Ra} T \hat{\mathbf{z}}
$$
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0
$$

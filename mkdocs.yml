## Add the pages you want built here
#
#  The hierarchy of the list describes how these pages will be represented in the navigation
#  bar at the top of the page. Either as individual links or as a dropdown menu of links

pages:
- index.md
- Map.md
- About:
    - 'How to write a new page' : WritingContent.md
    - 'Installation instructions' : Instructions.md

## Here is how to add extra (usually external) links to the navigation bar
#
# 1) Add a link to the nav bar
#     The item you add is a two-member list: ["Name for the link", "url"]
# 2) Add a new menu item to the nav bar
#     The item you add is a three-or-more-member list with a name for the menu item as the first member
#     and subsequent entries being lists of names / urls as above:
#     [ "Menu name", ["Menu item 1 name", "Menu item 1 url"], ["Menu item 2 name", "Menu item 2 url"], ... ]
#

    nav_links:
        - ["Live Content",
            ["Notebooks", "/notebooks/Notebooks" ],
            ["Terminal", "/terminals/1" ]
          ]
        - [ "Source Code",
            ["Local", "/notebooks/docs"],
            ["Github", "https://github.com/lmoresi/notebook-web-template"]
          ]



## No need to change these config options unless you want to change the theme or the
#  layout of the navigation bar.
#
#  Some of these options are not intuitive so take care !
